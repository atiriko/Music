which chords are in a major scale
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a major scale, the chords built on each degree are typically as follows:

I (Tonic) - Major
ii (Supertonic) - Minor
iii (Mediant) - Minor
IV (Subdominant) - Major
V (Dominant) - Major
vi (Submediant) - Minor
vii° (Leading tone) - Diminished
For example, in the C major scale, the chords would be:

C major (I)
D minor (ii)
E minor (iii)
F major (IV)
G major (V)
A minor (vi)
B diminished (vii°)
Let me know if you’d like more details about any of these chords!

what about the minor scale
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a natural minor scale, the chords built on each degree are as follows:

i (Tonic) - Minor
ii° (Supertonic) - Diminished
III (Mediant) - Major
iv (Subdominant) - Minor
v (Dominant) - Minor
VI (Submediant) - Major
VII (Subtonic) - Major
For example, in the A minor scale, the chords would be:

A minor (i)
B diminished (ii°)
C major (III)
D minor (iv)
E minor (v)
F major (VI)
G major (VII)
If you're looking at harmonic or melodic minor scales, the chords can differ a bit. Would you like to explore those as well?

what determines wether a chord is gonna be  major or minor for i ii III iv v VI VII
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The quality of the chords (major, minor, or diminished) in a scale is determined by the intervals between the notes in the chord. Here’s a breakdown:

Major Chords
Structure: Root, Major Third, Perfect Fifth
Example: C major (C-E-G)
Intervals: The distance between the root and third is four half steps, and from the third to the fifth is three half steps.
Minor Chords
Structure: Root, Minor Third, Perfect Fifth
Example: A minor (A-C-E)
Intervals: The distance between the root and third is three half steps, and from the third to the fifth is four half steps.
Diminished Chords
Structure: Root, Minor Third, Diminished Fifth
Example: B diminished (B-D-F)
Intervals: The distance between the root and third is three half steps, and from the third to the fifth is three half steps.
Chord Qualities in a Scale
I: Major (Tonic)
ii: Minor (Supertonic)
iii: Minor (Mediant)
IV: Major (Subdominant)
V: Major (Dominant)
vi: Minor (Submediant)
vii°: Diminished (Leading Tone)
The quality of each chord is determined by the scale degrees they are built from, as well as the intervals between those degrees. For instance, in a major scale, the 1st, 4th, and 5th degrees are major because of the specific intervals created by the scale's structure, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th degrees are minor, and the 7th degree is diminished.

how does it work for other scales
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The chord qualities in other scales can vary depending on the scale's structure. Here are a few common scale types and how their chords are built:

Harmonic Minor Scale
The harmonic minor scale raises the seventh degree of the natural minor scale, which affects the chords:

i (Tonic) - Minor
ii° (Supertonic) - Diminished
III+ (Mediant) - Major (augmented)
iv (Subdominant) - Minor
V (Dominant) - Major
vi (Submediant) - Major
vii° (Leading tone) - Diminished
Example in A Harmonic Minor:

A minor (i)
B diminished (ii°)
C major (III)
D minor (iv)
E major (V)
F major (VI)
G# diminished (vii°)
Melodic Minor Scale
The melodic minor scale raises both the sixth and seventh degrees when ascending and reverts to the natural minor when descending. This results in different chords:

i (Tonic) - Minor
ii (Supertonic) - Minor
III (Mediant) - Major
IV (Subdominant) - Major
v (Dominant) - Minor (when descending, it's often a diminished chord)
VI (Submediant) - Major
vii° (Leading tone) - Diminished
Example in A Melodic Minor (ascending):

A minor (i)
B minor (ii)
C major (III)
D major (IV)
E minor (v)
F# major (VI)
G# diminished (vii°)
Blues Scale
The blues scale includes both minor and major elements and has a characteristic sound, often using the flattened third, fifth, and seventh:

i (Tonic) - Minor
♭III (Mediant) - Major
IV (Subdominant) - Major
♭V (Diminished) - Diminished or augmented (often treated flexibly)
♭VII (Subtonic) - Major
Example in A Blues:

A minor (i)
C major (♭III)
D major (IV)
D# diminished (♭V)
G major (♭VII)
Other Scales
Different modes (like Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, etc.) and scales (like pentatonic) will have their own specific chord qualities based on the intervals created by their unique structures.

If you have a specific scale or mode in mind, let me know, and I can give you more detailed information about it!
